number of likely infections, so far the death rate of the coronavirus is calibrated a bit differently \\u2014 apparently predicated both on known deaths and known cases. When we make facile comparisons between the flu and coronaviruses, they may prove valid, but for now it\\u2019s still wise to remember that annual flu cases could be fewer than what is guessed at through modeling each year, and corona infections may be higher than the current known numbers of confirmed positives. The former reality might mean that the flu is at times a little more lethal than we think and the corona virus a little less deadly. That is not to suggest that most strains of flu are as lethal as the coronavirus, only that for the vast majority of Americans the current U.S. COVID-19 case-to-fatality ratio of 2 percent may eventually prove less, and influenza\\u2019s commonly cited 0.01 lethality rate may prove higher. In any case, 98\\u201399 percent of Americans may well recover from the coronavirus \\u2014 a rate that is not typical of most of history\\u2019s plagues.\\n\\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe realities are paradoxical: If the coronavirus infects as many Americans as an average flu strain, then ten times more Americans could die \\u2014 mostly over the age of 65 \\u2014 even as the vast majority of all Americans will not. Statistics change hourly, but the CDC as of the afternoon of March 16 reports that there are currently 3,437 cases of known coronavirus infections and 68 deaths attributed to the virus, or about two deaths per 100 infected \\u2014 the majority of them again likely over 65.\\n\\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo the degree that we are suffering death and economic hurt from COVID-19, we can also attribute the toll to the Chinese Communist Party. Had it just called in the international medical community in late November, instituted early quarantines, and allowed its own citizens to use email and social media to apprise and warn others of the new disease, then the world and the U.S. would probably not have found themselves in the current panic. The reasons China did not act more responsibly may be inherent in communist governments, or they may involve more Byzantine causes left to be disclosed.\\n\\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAdd in the proximity of a Level 4 virology lab nearby Ground Zero of COVID-19, which fueled Internet conspiracy theories; the weird rumors about quite strange animals such as snakes and pangolins birthing the infection in primeval open meat markets stocked with live animals in filthy conditions in cages; and pirated videos of supposed patients dropping comatose in crowded hospital hallways. With all of that, we had the ingredients of a Hollywood zombie movie, adding to the frenzy.\\n\\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPlus, 2020 is an election year \\u2014 echoing how the 1976 swine flu was politicized. The Left and its media appendages saw COVID-19 as able to do what John Brennan, James Clapper, James Comey, and Andrew McCabe, the Mueller team, and impeachment could not: destroy the hated Trump presidency.\\n\\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\\n\\nChina will rue what it begat.\\n\\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThat is, it will come to appreciate fully that the supposed efficiency, ruthlessness, and autocracy of the Communist Party \\u2014 what had so impressed foolish American journalists who once marveled at Beijing\\u2019s ability to enact by fiat liberal pet projects such as high-speed rail and solar industries \\u2014 were China\\u2019s worst enemies, ensuring that the virus would spread and that China\\u2019s international reputation would be ruined.\\n\\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe coronavirus could be the straw that breaks the proverbial back of the Chinese camel, stooped under the recent weight of a trade war with the U.S., the revelation of 1 million Uighurs in reeducation camps, the crackdown on Hong Kong democracy protesters, and news of the sprawling Chinese internal-surveillance apparat. The world is now both terrified and put off by China, and such anathemas will only harm its already suspect and misbegotten Silk Road neocolonial schemes.\\n\\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHere in the U.S., COVID-19 will create bipartisan pressure to adopt policies of keeping key U.S. industries \\u2014 such as medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and military applied high-tech \\u2014 in America. Americans will not again wish to outsource the vast majority of their chemotherapy-drug, antibiotic, and heart-medicine production to a government that cannot be trusted and that sees such globalized output as a weapon to be used in extremis.\\n\\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAlthough we cannot see it now, spin-off effects from the panic and frenzy will eventually fuel more economic recovery. Oil prices are nearing record modern lows, ensuring cheap gas for spring and summer American drivers. Cheap mortgages and car loans likewise will spur buying, as will relief once the virus wanes and splurging ensue.\\n\\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt will be salutary for Americans to once again appreciate the value of muscular labor, as those who grow food, transport it, and provide us energy and sanitation while protecting us from danger, foreign and domestic, have allowed millions of Americans to stay home, sequestered and quarantined but safe with plenty of food, water, and uninterrupted sanitation and public safety. In these days of crisis, we should not forget that millions of often unmentioned Americans have made us the world\\u2019s greatest energy and most diverse food producer \\u2014 a singular position that China, with over four times our population, envies.\\n\\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\\n\\n154\\n\\nBefore the outbreak, China was trying to game its trade war in terms of how best to hurt the hated Trump administration. Ironically, its abhorrence only strengthened the U.S. in ways no one in the pre-COVID-19 days could have imagined.\\n\\n\u0026amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCall it paradox, irony, karma, or even tragedy, but China emerges from its deceit about the coronavirus outbreak in its weakest position since its Westernization began under Deng Xiaoping. And the U.S., after some rocky months ahead, if it stays calm, will likely reemerge in its strongest state in memory vis-\\u00e0-vis its rivals.\\\"\",\n          \"No, it wasn't a mistake.\\n\\nThis was an exercise in looking at data if we completely disregard what the Chinese government is telling us, and make some predictions based on all the other information available to us.\\n\\nWhen we look at the lethality of SARS and MERS which are in the same family as this virus, a 1% lethality really is an ultra conservative estimate.\\n\\nRead this article\\n\\n [https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/image-deleted-from-tencent-sparks-doubt-about-official-virus-tally/news-story/54736a213dddd2e6d8d9d0b382ca34b6](https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/image-deleted-from-tencent-sparks-doubt-about-official-virus-tally/news-story/54736a213dddd2e6d8d9d0b382ca34b6) \\n\\nIt appears to directly backup some of my fears that the official figures are FAR higher than the government is saying.

Complete quarantine, virtual complete shutdown of the entire countries economy, jailing ANYONE who is spreading any non official information, moving all infected people into quarantine camps. These are no the actions of a government who thinks this virus is anything other than EXTREMELY serious.\\n\\nAlso look at this.\\n\\nA gentleman has all but proven through mathematical analysis that the CCP has quite simply just fabricated all of the numbers they are giving us so far.\\n\\nlink here.\\n\\n [https://twitter.com/evdefender/status/1223887384892313600?s=21](https://twitter.com/evdefender/status/1223887384892313600?s=21) \\n\\nhappy to discuss further at your leisure.\",\n          \"I made [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/fk1lvp/japanlife_coronavirus_megathread_ii/fkwodoo/) on /r/japanlife about the situation I'm dealing with trying to get tested in Japan. I'm pasting it here as well.\\n\\nI am an American living in Tokyo. I speak Japanese fluently, and all of the following interactions have been with Japanese doctors in Japanese.\\n\\nI've had the following symptoms, in rough order, since the 4th of March:\\n\\n* Headache\\n* Throat pain\\n* Fatigue\\n* Dry cough\\n* Chest pain\\n* Difficulty breathing\\n* Low SpO2 (sometimes as low as 85%)\\n\\nThese are all the exact symptoms of coronavirus, minus a fever. They come and go; sometimes I feel almost OK, but sometimes it's also so bad that I can barely walk. The highest my temperature has been is 37.2 degrees; it *feels* like I have a fever, but the thermometer doesn't show that. I am 30 years old with a childhood history of asthma.\\n\\nI went to a heart specialist on the 7th, since I thought it could have been a heart thing and I've been told I may have arrhythmia before. An EKG and ultrasound revealed nothing, so I went home with no medication.  \\nOn the 9th I went to a standard clinic, and had a chest X-ray and asthma test taken. Neither showed any irregularities. At this point I was starting to worry this may be the coronavirus, and when I asked the doctor about it he told me that it was likely just a cold. I got some painkillers and a cough suppressant and was sent on my way.  \\nThe same day, I called the Japanese coronavirus hotline, and was told that I likely don't have coronavirus because I don't have a high enough fever.\\n\\nI called a clinic on the 12th and was told they didn't have any machines to do X-rays or similar tests, and to go to a large hospital. I called up a hospital on the 13th, and explained my symptoms on the phone (without mentioning coronavirus), and they told me to come in. When I got there, I was placed in a separate room and was told that they will be unable to see me because I am displaying coronavirus symptoms. When I explained that the hotline told me to go to a hospital, they just told me to call the hotline again. I wasn't able to get tested because they said I don't have the virus, but I also wasn't able to get medical treatment because I might have the coronavirus.\\n\\nOn the 14th I went back to the clinic where I had the X-ray taken, and had a letter of introduction to another hospital written. I went to that hospital, and had blood taken, another EKG, another X-ray, and another asthma test. I spoke to my doctor about possibly having coronavirus again, and that it's likely not a good idea for me to wait in the waiting room with dozens of old people around me. I was told once again that it's unlikely that I have coronavirus. A second appointment was set up on the 21st. My symptoms were relatively light at the time I went to the hospital, but I have been taking a picture of my SpO2 monitor every time it showed below 95% (a few dozen times). The doctor dismissed those as a poorly applied or calibrated meter.  \\nI went back on the 16th, due to my symptoms getting significantly worse over Sunday. The blood test results were in, and they showed nothing unusual. My symptoms were a little bit worse than on the 14th, so the doctor had another EKG and a heart ultrasound taken. Neither showed anything unusual, so I was scheduled to have a holter monitor (take-home 24 hour EKG) attached, which was done so on the 17th and returned yesterday, on the 18th. I spoke to a second doctor at the hospital and was told the same thing; that I don't have coronavirus and that it's likely a cold.  \\n\\nMy next appointment is on the 6th of April, but my condition continues to worsen, and my wife (32 years old) is starting to show symptoms as well. I have been taking off work ever since my symptoms started, but my wife absolutely refuses to take off work no matter how much I beg her.  \\nI have called every single hotline and phone number I can think of; every single one has told me that I don't have a high enough fever, and that there is no possibility I have coronavirus. I've tried explaining to them that I may be spreading it to the most vulnerable part of the population when I go to the hospital, but they still tell me that I don't have it and that I just need to talk to a doctor. I've even called the US Embassy, who told me to just see a doctor in Japan.\\n\\nWhat the fuck do I *do*? My breathing is getting bad enough sometimes that I feel like I might need to call an ambulance, but no one, not even my own wife is taking me seriously.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":

This was the key to alot of US strength and it was build by alot of good hardworking people + luck of not being touched by any major war. If something like farming goes down we can subsidize it with oil money or tech money. Somehow one way or another over the past 4 years the country manage to fuck just about everything there is to fuck up. \\n\\nThere isn't much left to fuck up. Now finance has manage to fuck itself up from being grossly irresponsible. So now what is really the question. \\n\\n\\\\*Ok large rant because I might not have a job after April and i'm very fucking salty because my entire life has been this shit show of recessions and war\\\\*\\n\\nOk its not really \\\"somehow\\\" tariffs fucked up farming, OPEC fucked up oil, corona fucked up manufacturing, regulations or lack of, fucked up tech, and finance got fucked up by rates.  \\n\\nAll of this shit happened in 4 years and we keep managing to do things to hurt us while already still paying off all the bullshit 10 years ago like housing , 2 wars, healthcare. Its been 20 years of constant fucking it up and we needed to keep the bandages on until the entire country healed completely and fix alot of internal problems. Truth is things never really got any better for most people, just slightly back to normal.  Now trump basically ripped off the bandage prematurely and made more fights than what we were already in as while every SINGLE congress has done fucking nothing for 10+ years cause a certain group likes to stop fucking everything .\\n\\nPoint is this isn't an accident the US was so robust you have to actively try to destroy it.

I'm a Comic Con vendor and work part time at a bead shop. We've been grinding ever downward since 2016. In 2019 first we had in-person sales tank even worse than the general economy. Next my supplies tripled in price AGAIN. Hong Kong and China fight means I can't get gold plated items so discontinue my most popular item. Then shipping went up. Then listing fees and transaction fees for my online sales went up. Online sales then had sales tax applied automatically instead of being included in my item price (I use VAT and lump sum my quarterly taxes per state). I now have to spend more than double the time filing taxes because my reports per state are now wrong because I pay in person and online on 2 other sites but 1 site decided to submit reports for us! This time takes away from making, photographing, and marketing time, so I post fewer new items for sale. Shows begin to die off as bankruptcies, consolidations, and rescheduling or relocating rocks the industry. Others increased booth fees to make up for lower ticket sales. Due to loss of selling days and acceptable profit margin I'm behind on my business bills and taxes (so goodbye remaining profit as I'm now paying compound interest and late fees). Because I'm late my credit is now bad and I can't get a consolidation loan to reduce the total payments due. Next my online sales and consignment store sales went down massively over 2018 too because of the market contraction. \\n\\nEnter Covid19. My parts dry up because Chinese manufacturing can't ship anything. My backup sources in other countries (more expensive) take over briefly, but then have to shut down too. As the virus spreads into Seattle my biggest show gets cancelled. Other shows start rescheduling for 2021 as no crowd rules go into effect. All 1st quarter shows are rescheduled for later this year (so I had to cancel some due to schedule conflicts) others are now \\\"date TBD\\\". My fees are rolling to the next show when it happens so no cash refund to pay other bills (can't resent this as refund would bankrupt the show producers). Online sales drop off completely as no one is buying cosplay items if they aren't going to a show or filming and performing. My store now cuts hours radically and cancels all classes and Bead Night because of social distancing. \\n\\n\\\"Stay at Home Order\\\" goes through as of today. The store is now closed outright as are all stores where I have pieces consigned. We aren't even allowed to go do inventory to keep workers occupied.This is probably going to put my store out of business permanently because we weren't even making a profit. It's a break even business before this started and the owner has even more debt than I do. She can't even pay to have full time employees. I have no paycheck and no consignment sales. I'm waiting on clarification if I'm allowed to ship goods if anyone orders as it's not \\\"essential business\\\" for me to go to the post office. The post office is open and making delivery but for how long will they ship things other than \\\"essential\\\" packages? \\n\\nNormally I can't file for Unemployment because I'm self employed. I'm not disabled enough to get benefits but I'm too disabled to go back to my old career. I'm hoping the rules change because I am totally and utterly fucked otherwise. My husband's job is probably not in danger. He's at home call center tech support for a bank and is now doing not just mandatory overtime but \\\"voluntary\\\" part time on weekends too, poor guy. The Philippines and India call centers are closed right now because of quarantine. He says he might as well work every hour he can because there's fuck all else to do. I will not starve or lose my house, unlike a lot of my friends in the industry. \\n\\nMy husband pays for mortgage, insurance, water \u0026amp; power, internet, car payment, and \\\"not gonna starve\\\" food. My income pays for clothes, cell phone, streaming tv and games, gas for the car, \\\"nice\\\" groceries, office equipment, cat food, litter, vet, and anything extra like family visiting, presents, or emergency expenses. Except for the cat food and litter we'll survive without my income pretty long in this emergency.\\n\\nOn a side note, I have been in self quarantine for 21 days now so lost my paycheck from those weeks we were open too. I would have had to cancel Seattle even if he show went on. I had what I thought was flu, but flu does NOT last for 21 days so tomorrow my doc is calling to see if I need to go to the hospital and get tested for pneumonia and possibly Covid19. Pretty sure I don't have Covid19 as the symptoms aren't really a match but they keep updating the symptoms lists now so... Wish me luck.\",\n          \"People are very bad at doing statistics/probability in their heads or intuitively, so you shouldn't feel bad about not intrinsically knowing how to do it. \\n\\nI find these types of probabilities much easier to reason about by starting with the entire population \u0026amp; narrowing from there. There are around 1k-10k of in the US with the coronavirus right now (pessimistically, let's say 10k). As a wild approximation, we'll say that ~500k people in the US have the flu right now (based on ~10 million getting it a year). Now, suppose that the only things that cause a fever are the flu \u0026amp; coronavirus and that we want to diagnose someone that has a fever. Even if all coronavirus cases and only 20% of flu cases develop a fever, that leaves us with 10k people with (coronavirus \u0026amp; fever) and 100k people with (flu \u0026amp; fever), meaning that if all we know is someone has a fever that it's much more likely (~10:1) that they have the flu than the coronavirus. This [symptom chart](https://i.insider.com/5e6a58e684159f61963287a2?width=700\u0026amp;format=jpeg\u0026amp;auto=webp) seems informative.\\n\\nThis type of problem is [conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability) \\\"the probability of X given that Y is true\\\", typically written P(X | Y). The key insight is that P(X | Y) and P(Y | X) are not particularly related, especially when P(X) and P(Y) are of significantly different sizes. This is a common enough mistake to have a [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_of_the_inverse). For instance, imagine how \\\"is very wealthy - top 0.1%\\\" and \\\"owns a house\\\" interact. By definition P(rich) = 0.1%. At a guess, say P(house) ~= 50%. Almost all very wealthy people own a house: P(house | rich) ~= 99%, but it's obviously not the case that almost all people that own a house are very wealthy: P(rich | house) ~= 0.2%. To stay on theme, P(hungry | stoned) is a lot higher than P(stoned | hungry).\\n\\nIn this case, P(fever | covid) is high (~88%), but our initial estimate of P(covid) is so low compared to P(flu) that observing a fever isn't enough to convince us that someone with a fever has covid - P(covid | fever) isn't that high. On the other hand, while P(shortness of breath | covid) \u0026lt; P(covid | fever), P(shortness of breath | flu) is much, much lower, so P(covid | shortness of breath \u0026amp; fever) is much, much higher than is intuitive.\",\n          \"[This article in the New Statesman seems good](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/03/why-uk-s-approach-coronavirus-such-risk). Says that whilst we will probably look back at it and say our early failures in testing prevented containment of the virus, from where we are now we can only really control and Britains strategy is bold and intelligent (though not without risks). Though it focuses a little too much on the herd immunity thing, which is more just a cosnequence of the government's plan (if any substantial immunity is available), but not the main plan itself, but it does explain why the government is using this strategy rather than stricter quarantines. \\n\\n\u0026gt;One of my favourite aphorisms concerns two archetypal doctors \\u2013 one a surgeon, the other a physician \\u2013 confronted by a patient with a life-threatening emergency. \\u201cDon\\u2019t just stand there, do something!\\u201d shouts the surgeon. \\u201cDon\\u2019t just do something, stand there,\\u201d the physician replies.\\n\\n\u0026gt;Originally a humorous encapsulation of the different character traits typifying these two very different branches of medicine \\u2013 surgeons, decisive people of action; physicians, cerebral theorists \\u2013 it strikes me the aphorism could be repurposed to describe the divergence in the management of the coronavirus pandemic emerging between the UK and the rest of the world.\\n\\n\u0026gt;Numerous other countries, many with far fewer confirmed cases than us, are imposing restrictions on the gathering and daily movement of their people, as well as banning immigration. The UK did have its own case-based containment phase, but last week it officially shifted to a delay phase. At present this consists largely in voluntary efforts: self-isolation in the event of respiratory symptoms; good hygiene practices; and a degree of social distancing and home-working.\\n\\n\u0026gt;This approach has received widespread criticism, including from professor John Ashton, a former regional director of public health, and from senior figures in the World Health Organisation. These are not voices to be dismissed lightly. And faced with a serious public health threat, it does feel unnerving not to be employing stringent counter-measures. Surely we should be closing schools and universities, limiting travel and public events? (A ban on mass gatherings is expected from next week.) Shouldn\\u2019t everyone with a temperature or cough be being tested? That would feel like we were doing something. And in some countries, such as China, South Korea, and Singapore, these kinds of approaches have brought new case numbers down impressively.\\n\\n\u0026gt;Dealing with this pandemic is going to be a marathon, however, not a sprint. Underpinning UK strategy is the conviction that the virus is not eradicable by containment. Covid-19 is a perfect storm of a pathogen. It causes minor enough illness in most patients to make it hard to detect and therefore isolate every case, meaning it spreads itself very effectively. Once strict population-based containment measures \\u2013 which severely curtail normal life and are not sustainable long-term \\u2013 are lifted and people start travelling and mixing again, it won\\u2019t be long before coronavirus resurges. \\n\\n\u0026gt;Superimposed on this is the tendency for viral infections to come in waves, typically peaking in winter months. And unlike the 2009 pandemic of swine flu, which had an exceptionally low mortality rate (around 0.02 per cent), Covid-19 has the capacity to send at least 5 per cent of affected people into intensive care, many of whom won\\u2019t survive. The accounts coming out of Italy this past week are a chilling demonstration of what happens to a health system hit by a sudden surge of critical cases \\u2013 it has been utterly overwhelmed.\\n\\n\u0026gt;If coronavirus can\\u2019t be eradicated by containment, and if, unchecked, it will completely outstrip our capacity to care for serious cases, then the best way of managing it is to gain some control over the timing and rate of the inevitable infections. This is the UK\\u2019s ambitious strategy \\u2013 to flatten and draw out the first wave.\\n\\n\u0026gt;Think of coronavirus cases as water flowing through a hose. Population-based containment would be like pinching the pipe so hard that you shut it off completely, but the force required can\\u2019t be maintained forever; soon muscles fatigue and cramp, and the water starts up again. What the UK is attempting is to regulate the flow. At present the water pressure (new case numbers) is low, so relatively little force is needed to limit the flow rate \\u2013 these are our current low-key tactics. As water pressure rises, the hose needs to be squeezed harder to keep the flow rate controlled \\u2013 these will be the institutional closures, event cancellations, and travel restrictions we\\u2019re told may come.\\n\\n\u0026gt;If successful, the UK will reach next winter with a substantial proportion of the population immune to Covid-19, while having maintained the capacity to care for severely affected patients in intensive care units along the way. The anticipated second wave next winter will be dramatically attenuated. \\n\\n\u0026gt;But there are huge uncertainties. No country has ever tried to regulate the rate of a pandemic in this way before. And assumptions about acquired immunity may be upturned should Covid-19 \\u2013 the biology of which is still largely unknown \\u2013 prove itself capable of mutating to evade the immune system as influenza routinely does.\\n\\n\u0026gt;When we look back, I suspect we will see our rigid initial case definition \\u2013 based purely on travel history or known contact with a confirmed case \\u2013 and attendant restriction on testing as having fatally undermined our case-based attempt at containment. But given where we are now, our strategy of trying to control what is inevitably approaching strikes me as both bold and intelligent. It is not without risk, though, and only in time will we know whether it was the right choice.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n
